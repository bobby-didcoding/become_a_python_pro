# <span style="color:#f9b000">Become A Python Pro</span>

Welcome to the supporting doc's to my 'Become A Python Pro' course.

<span style="color:#f9b000">Feel free to use this repo as a 'cheat sheet'</span>

## Getting started
First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. I have called mine 'become-a-python-pro'. This is your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this a few different ways. I use SSH...

```
    #option 1 - SSH
    git clone git@github.com:bobby-didcoding/become_a_python_pro.git .

    #option 2 - Github CLI
    gh repo clone bobby-didcoding/become_a_python_pro .

    #option 3 - HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/become_a_python_pro.git .
```
>Note: You can also download the project as a zip file.
