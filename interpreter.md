## What is the Python interpreter?
A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand.


## Open a new interpreter
Open a new terminal and simply type:
```
python
```
You should now see the following in your terminal.
```
Python 3.10.2 (tags/v3.10.2:a58ebcc, Jan 17 2022, 14:12:15) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
Have a little play in the interpreter with some python sums.
```
1+1
9/3
6*7
10**4
```
You should see the following:

## Closing/exiting interpreter

Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesnâ€™t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command:

```
>>>quit()
```
